# PoroTomo
PoroTomo DAS data in both SEG-Y and .h5 formats with tutorial notebook for use.

These data were collected during March 2016 at Brady Hot Springs, NV. Silixa’s
iDAS (TM) was used for data acquisition with 1.021 m channel spacing and a
guage length of 10 m. Data in this archive are in .sgy and .h5 files with raw
units (radians of optical phase change per time sample) (Miller, et al.).

The files in this dataset use SEG-y-rev1 (see below for documentation). The
data are also available in .h5 or HDF5 file format.

Horizontal DAS (DASH) data collection began 3/8/16, paused, and then started
again on 3/11/2016 and ended 3/26/2016 using zigzag trenched fiber optic
cabels. Vertical DAS (DASV) data collection began 3/17/2016 and ended 3/28/16
using a fiber optic cable through the first 363 m of a vertical well.

Files are stored in daily directories labeled using the format YYYYMMDD.
Individual files names include the date and time appended at the end in the
format YYMMDDHHMMSS. Each file respresents 30 s of data.

DASH SEG-Y files:
    size: ~1-2 GB each
    shape: 8721 traces x 30000 samples/trace
DASV SEG-Y files:
    size: ~0.01-0.02 GB each
    shape: 384 traces x 30000 samples/trace.
DASH .h5 files:
    size: ~1 GB
DASV .h5 files:
    size: ~1 GB
